## What is this code?

A little jokempo game made using what I learned so far about JAVA. Building these little projects is a way for me to not only get better at
coding but also seeing how much I learned.

## Why is it all in english?

English is, so far, the universal language. I believe writting code in english is what I will be doing when I get to actually work as a dev so it is better to get used to it already.
